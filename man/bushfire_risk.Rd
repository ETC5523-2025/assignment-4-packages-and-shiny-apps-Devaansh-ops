\format{
A tibble with 4 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
\item{index}{Fire-weather index code (character).}
\item{region}{Geographic region represented (character).}
\item{metric}{Description of what the index measures (character).}
\item{baseline_prob}{Probability of an extreme event in the pre-industrial climate.}
\item{current_prob}{Probability of an extreme event in today's ~1°C warming climate.}
\item{risk_ratio}{How many times more likely the event is today vs historical climate.}
\item{lower_bound}{Conservative ‘safe estimate’ of the risk ratio.}

\description{
A tidy dataset summarising the model-derived bushfire-weather probabilities
used in the Black Summer attribution study (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021).
}
\details{
Each row represents one fire-weather index and contains the baseline and
current probabilities for extreme conditions, along with the risk ratio and a
conservative lower bound used by climate scientists.

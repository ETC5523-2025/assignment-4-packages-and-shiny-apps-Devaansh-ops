🌏 **The Inferno Down Under: Unravelling a Climate Mystery**

Australia’s *Black Summer* of 2019–2020 was not just another bushfire season —

it was a national trauma.

➡️ **19 million hectares burned**

➡️ **6,000+ buildings destroyed**

➡️ **34 human lives lost**

➡️ **Over 1.5 billion animals killed**

➡️ **Smoke that circled the globe**

An entire continent seemed ablaze.

At the same time, one question grew louder:

> **Was this simply a horrific natural disaster, or did human-driven climate change fuel the flames?**

The scientific community set out to answer this — not through politics, but through

**attribution science**, data, and climate modelling.

This vignette walks through the findings of van Oldenborgh et al. (2021) while making the science accessible, visual, and deeply human.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔍 **Removing the Layers: What the Scientists Did**

Event attribution science compares:

-   **World A:** The climate *with* human greenhouse gas emissions

-   **World B:** A hypothetical world *without* human emissions (pre-industrial)

Researchers used:

✔ **ERA5 reanalysis (1979–2020)** for historic weather

✔ **MODIS satellite imagery** to map burned regions

✔ **11 climate model ensembles** (CMIP5 + CMIP6)

✔ Fire-weather indicators like FWI and TX7x

At the core of the study lies the:

> **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** — a metric for fire danger based on temperature, wind, humidity, and rainfall.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🌡️ **A World Heating Up: The Temperature Story**

Here’s a simulated demonstration of how warming trends appear over time:

```{r}
#| label: fig-temp-trend
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Simulated temperature anomalies in southeastern Australia (1900–2020), showing a clear warming trend amid natural variability."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

set.seed(42)
data <- data.frame(
  Year = 1900:2020,
  Temp = rnorm(121, mean = seq(0, 2, length.out = 121), sd = 0.5)
)

ggplot(data, aes(Year, Temp)) +
  geom_line(color = "#D55E00", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#0072B2", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Rising Heat: Temperature Anomalies Over Time",
    x = "Year", y = "Temperature Anomaly (°C)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```

🔥 **Finding #1 — Heatwaves were 1–2°C hotter than they would have been without human emissions.**

This alone doubled the likelihood of extreme heat events.

🔥 **Fire Risk: How Much Worse Did Climate Change Make It?**

```{r tbl-fire-risk, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)

fire_risk_data <- data.frame(
  Climate_Scenario = c("Pre-industrial baseline",
                       "Current climate (1°C warming)",
                       "Future (2°C warming)"),
  Probability_Ratio = c("1.0×", "1.3–1.8×", "4–8×"),
  Risk_Increase = c("Baseline", "30–80% higher", "300–700% higher")
)

kable(fire_risk_data,
      col.names = c("Climate Scenario", "Probability Ratio", "Risk Increase"))
```

👉 **Even today, climate change has increased extreme fire-weather risk by at least 30%.**

At +2°C global warming, this increases dramatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 💨 **Drought: The Surprising Twist**

Heat clearly showed a human fingerprint.

Drought, however, did **not** show a clear anthropogenic trend.

Why?

-   2019 drought was strongly influenced by **natural climate modes**:
    -   **IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole)** — extremely positive

    -   **SAM (Southern Annular Mode)** — extremely negative

This means **climate change did not directly cause the drought**, but it magnified the impacts by intensifying heat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧩 **Putting It Together: What Really Drove Black Summer?**

✔ Human-driven warming → **increased likelihood of fire-favourable weather**

✔ Natural variability → **triggered the extreme drought**

✔ Combined effect → **a historically unprecedented fire season**

Even more striking:

> **FWI values reached levels with pre-industrial return periods of over 1,000 years.**

We turned a bad year into a catastrophic one.

A reminder that attribution is not just statistics — it is lived reality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🚨 **Lessons, Warnings, and What Comes Next**

The science tells us three things:

### 1️⃣ Climate change is already amplifying extreme fire-weather conditions.

### 2️⃣ The impacts will worsen at higher warming levels.

### 3️⃣ Immediate adaptation + mitigation strategies are essential.

This means:

-   Stronger fire-management systems

-   Better early-warning systems

-   Smarter fuel-load management

-   Emission reductions to limit future risk

The Black Summer is not just behind us — it is a preview.
